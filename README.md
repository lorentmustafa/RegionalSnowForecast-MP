--TITLE-

Balkans Snow

--DESCRIPTION--

Being both snow lovers ourselves, we came across the idea of making an application that gives accurate predictions of snow fall in the winter time,
this being very helpful to skiers and snowboarders around Balkans.
We are gonna be mainly covering the ski resorts in the Western and Eastern Balkan, thus including Brezovica, Popova Sapka, Mavrovo, Kolasin, Bansko.
Real-Time snow predictions, wind speed, humidity, and many more made accessible by the Rest API we used in our application.
(NOTE) - In this pandemic time, both students had a scheduled meeting daily, on a specific time meeting on Google Meet, and worked accross solutions on 
making this application the best it could be, and offering the snow lovers the thing they want.
